# Project Net Worth

## Project Description
Project Net Worth a is desktop application that **tracks users' personal finances**. The application will be able to
take user inputs to keep track of their monthly income and expenses and net worth. Additionally, the application should 
be able to summarize their financial data so that users can make informed decisions based on their historical financial
data. 

This application is for **individuals, couples, families, and even small businesses who are looking to better manage
and track their finances**. I hope that users will become more financially literate and learn to manage their finances 
in a more structured manner by using this application. This project is of particular interest to me because 
**I am a huge proponent for financial literacy and closely manage and invest my finances to reach short-term and 
long-term goals myself.** For example: this application should be able to help many people who want to reach 
*F.I.R.E.* (financial independence, retire early).
